This white paper was an assignment for my Computer and Network Security course (2018), Master's Degree in Computer Science, University of Padova.

*Abstract:
This paper wants to outline and summarize the current state-of-the-art regarding UAV security. Civilian/amateur UAVs (small UAVs) will be the main targets. This is motivated by the ever-growing market share represented by this technology. A silent but crucial revolution is currently taking place: drones are becoming more and more affordable, with applications in a wide range of fields. Unfortunately, the security aspect was overlooked by manufacturers, dismissing potential threats and considering small UAVs mere toys. To prove once again the importance of drone security, vulnerabilities and real-world examples of dangerous attacks are showed. Possible countermeasures are also described and evaluated.*
